    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        I'm a non-profit co-founder turned Full Stack Developer. As co-founder of Cass-Clay 
        Integration Center, I saw how technology could transform our operations—so I learned 
        to code and built a client management system that reduced administrative time
        and significantly improved data accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Specializing in React, Node.js, and C#, I bring both technical skills and real-world 
        leadership experience to every project. My background in non-profit management gives 
        me unique insight into user needs, stakeholder communication, and building solutions 
        that create meaningful impact. Based in Fargo, ND, I'm seeking opportunities to 
        contribute to innovative teams where I can leverage both my development skills and 
        leadership experience.
